      title: WRF South America Experiment
      summary: 
        2D hourly average Fields from the WRF South America experiment. Simulations are 20-40 years long, but only 2020 stored here.
    
        [**Resolutions**]
          *  Levels 0-10 for 2D fields. 

        **Processing**
          * Fields were sextracted from raw data
          * Then remapped to HEALPix level 10 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. 
          * Lower levels were generated from this using coarse-graining.
