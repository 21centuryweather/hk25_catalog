      title: NICAM 3.5 km simulation
      summary: |
        Atmosphere-only simulation at 3.5 km resolution. One-year data from 10-year simulations starting in 2011.

        **Simulation**
          * Horizontal grid: Glevel-11, 41,943,042 control volumes (hexagon/pentagon), average interaval (dx) ~ 3.5 km
          * Vertical grid: 78 full levels with the model top of about 50 km
          * Initial conditions: From ERA-Interim for date 2011-01-01T00:00:00Z
          * External data:
            * SST and SIC predicted by a slab-ocean model (mixed layer depth 15m), nudged to daily mean fields from OSTIA with a 7-day relaxation time
            * Greenhouse gases as daily values, following HighResMIP protocol
            * O3 prescribed from monthly fields, following HighResMIP protocol
            * Greenhouse gases and O3 With SSP585 scenario after 2015, following HighResMIP protocol

        **Processing**
          * Fields were remapped from the 3.5 km NICAM to the Healpix grid with conservative remapping.
          * 2d1h fields have instantaneous values except for precipitation (pr).
          * 2d3h fields have mean values calculated from each simulation timestep values.
          * 3d6h fields are generated on 25 pressure levels as instantaneous values starting at 6-hourly interval.
